    - git commit -m   (commit with message)
    - git push        (push to GitHub)
    - git log         (view commit history)

Git Commands Mastered:
----------------------
- git init
- git config --global user.name
- git config --global user.email
- git remote add origin
- git branch -M main
- git add
- git commit
- git push
- git status
- git log --oneline

Practice Exercises Completed:
-----------------------------
[✓] Created test files with echo
[✓] Viewed files with cat
[✓] Searched text with grep
[✓] Found files with find
[✓] Changed permissions with chmod
[✓] Copied and moved files
[✓] Checked system resources
[✓] Connected to GitHub
[✓] Made first commits
[✓] Created working shell script

Scripts Created:
---------------
1. system-check.sh - Automated system health monitoring

Key Learnings:
-------------
- > overwrites files, >> appends to files
- chmod +x makes scripts executable
- Git tracks changes locally, GitHub stores remotely
- -h flag usually means "human-readable"
- . (dot) means current directory
- .. (double dot) means parent directory
- ~ (tilde) means home directory

Common Patterns Noticed:
-----------------------
- Most commands have -h or --help for help
- -r usually means recursive
- -f usually means force
- -a usually means all
- -l usually means long/detailed format

Mistakes Made & Lessons:
-----------------------
1. Forgot to use sudo for system commands
   Lesson: Use sudo for administrative tasks

2. Used > instead of >> and lost data
   Lesson: > overwrites, >> appends

3. Tried to git push without remote
   Lesson: Need to connect to GitHub first

4. Forgot chmod +x on script
   Lesson: Scripts need execute permission

Commands to Practice More Tomorrow:
-----------------------------------
- ps (process status)
- top / htop (process monitoring)
- kill (terminate processes)
- systemctl (service management)
- sed (stream editor)
- awk (text processing)
- pipe | (combining commands)
- tail -f (follow logs in real-time)

Total Commands Practiced: 22+
Time Spent: 2.5 hours
Confidence Level: 7/10

Next Session Goals:
------------------
[ ] Master process management
[ ] Learn text processing (sed, awk)
[ ] Create 2 more utility scripts
[ ] Practice command piping
[ ] Learn about system services

Notes:
------
- Everything is working well
- Git workflow is smooth now
- Ready for more advanced topics
- System resources are adequate for learning
