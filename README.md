#### ✅ Day 2 - November 5, 20git add README.md
git commit -m "Update: Day 2 complete summary with new skills and scripts"
git push25
**Time Spent:** 3 hours  
**Status:** COMPLETED

**What I Built:**
- ✅ `log-analyzer.sh` - Analyzes log files for errors, warnings, critical issues
- ✅ `backup-script.sh` - Automated backup with timestamps
- ✅ Process management documentation
- ✅ Text processing examples

**Skills Acquired:**
- Process management (ps, top, htop, kill, systemctl)
- Advanced grep patterns and options
- Stream editing with sed
- Text processing with awk
- Command piping and chaining
- Background job management
- System service management

**Commands Mastered:** 30+
- Process: ps, top, htop, kill, killall, pgrep, jobs, fg, bg
- Text: grep -E/-i/-n/-v/-c, sed, awk, sort, uniq, wc, cut, tr
- Pipes: |, combining multiple commands

**Scripts Created:**
1. log-analyzer.sh - Error/warning detection and statistics
2. backup-script.sh - Automated timestamped backups

**Confidence Level:** 8/10  
**Motivation:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

**Key Insights:**
- Pipes make simple commands incredibly powerful
- awk is perfect for column-based data
- Background jobs (&) essential for long processes
- systemctl is the gateway to all services
